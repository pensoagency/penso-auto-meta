                'SOOOOO stressed out,'' began the tweet. ''Have to make a tough decision and I know I'll probably hurt someone's feelings! Arrrrggghhhhh.''
                It appeared to be a stuff-up. A faceless staffer from National Australia Bank seemed to have tweeted his/her personal woes to NAB's thousands of followers. Some giggled sympathetically at what was surely a blunder. Only, it wasn't.
                The next day, the Saturday tabloids splashed with the news that NAB would pay the exit fees of customers to leave the other banks. The ''bank wars'' story was all over the television news that night. Also that day came another tweet from the NAB staffer: ''Thanks for your concern everyone. Relationships can be tough sometimes! Good advice helped.''
                It wasn't until Monday - Valentine's Day - that it became clear that the tweets were part of a cleverly executed public relations plan that started on Twitter. That day, NAB launched its advertising campaign telling customers it was ''breaking up'' with the other banks. The campaign achieved something previously unthinkable - it gave one of the big banks a sense of humour and made it look human.
                ''We used the channel [Twitter] as a way of creating a bit of interest but also having a bit of fun,'' says NAB's executive general manager of direct banking, Sam Plowman. ''The whole campaign around the break-up has been unbelievably successful for us on many dimensions, and our use of social media to launch our campaign reaffirms that this will be a very important channel.''
                In years past, such a campaign might have been launched the old-fashioned way - hold a media conference, and hope journalists will turn up and write about it. But the break-up campaign is a good example of how big companies are not only accepting the inevitable rise of social media - they are learning how to use them to their advantage.
                Plowman says social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook enable a two-way conversation with customers. And it's not just about spin. It's also a way of responding when customers vent their grievances online. It can also be used to try to defuse a situation. Last month, when customers at a few banks did not receive their usual pay transfer, NAB used Twitter to tweet apologies and promise to fix the problem.
                But on embracing social media, companies have been slow. NAB joined the Twitter conversation only last year. It now has 10 staff whose full-time job is to monitor social media and respond to unhappy tweets and Facebook posts. It's like a call centre in the social media sphere - without the long wait, with gritted teeth, on the phone.
                Companies like NAB, Telstra and Australia Post are among a growing number that are setting up social media units, with staff employed to monitor social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. If a customer tweets, for instance, that they are having trouble with their NAB account, the idea is for a NAB social media staff member to respond.
                Telstra has been one of the more prolific users of social media for more than two years. It uses Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, and also engages customers on blogs and forums. Kristen Boschma, head of online communications and social media at Telstra, says social media are good ways for customers to have their problems dealt with away from the telephone system. When a customer tweets about a Telstra woe, the telco's social media team of 10 can pick up the tweet and respond to those who need help.
                But, she says: ''The last thing we want to be is intrusive, so if two people are having a conversation and they're trading information on Telstra, we don't want to butt into it.''
                It all may sound rather Big Brother-esque - although Boschma says social media debunk this notion.
                ''The reason is the audience knows we're watching and therefore the power is actually transferred back to the audience and the consumer,'' she says.
                ''When we first started this, people were surprised and delighted that we tapped them on the shoulder and said, 'Can we help?' The transition is now what we're finding is the reputation has spread and people are coming to expect that there'll be online help. So instead of using Twitter as their option of last resort, we're now seeing a lot of people using it as their option for first resort.''
                But she cautions that misuse can backfire, pointing to the Queensland retailer that offered to donate $1 to flood-ravaged Queensland for every person who ''liked'' its Facebook page.
                ''The online audience said very strongly and very quickly, 'Hey guys, this is not the moment to be building your fan base. This is the moment to help'.'' The public backlash made the company pull the campaign and donate the money anyway.
                When Australia Post general manager of digital Brady Jacobsen joined the company a bit over a year ago, it had no social media presence. Now it engages with customers through Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube. ''I work on the simple ethos we will be where our customers are having conversations,'' he says.
                Jacobsen says US companies were doing this years ago and concedes that Australian companies were slow to follow. ''Once it started to become more mass-market, it was necessary because your average customers were in that space,'' he says.
                Companies also use it to communicate special offers. Airline Virgin has had Twitter sales with ''cheep'' seats. And when department store David Jones launches its Twitter and Facebook pages at the end of this month, part of its use will be to promote special offers and in-store celebrity appearances.
                Con Frantzeskos, digital strategy director at the DDB agency, says the old advertising days had a mentality of shouting at people and bombarding them with ads. But social media are changing this.
                ''If you are fair dinkum about building a relationship with your customers, you have to be aware of what they're saying about you,'' he says. ''Advertising builds awareness but conversations really do build those relationships.''
                The benefit for the consumer is they can avoid filing complaints through formal channels because companies are going directly to the source of the complaint. But he says if companies are serious about doing this, they have to meet the expectations they set.
                ''Where I've seen a lot of organisations stuff up is when they say yes we're on and then for whatever reason fall off and don't respond,'' he says. ''You really run the risk of being half-hearted in your approach.''
